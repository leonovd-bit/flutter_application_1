# Google Maps API Key Diagnostic Guide

## üîç Current API Key Information

**API Key:** `AIzaSyCi_mKaxg-CRH3UJ5LVHGWTd7TUcl1H4qg`

**Location:** `lib/app_v3/services/simple_google_maps_service.dart` (line 14)

---

## üî¥ Current Error

From your console logs:
```
[SimpleGoogleMaps] Response body: {
   "error_message" : "API keys with referer restrictions cannot be used with this API.",
   "results" : [],
   "status" : "REQUEST_DENIED"
}
```

**This error is NOT about billing or free trial** - it's about API key restrictions.

## üìä How to Check Your Google Cloud Account

### Step 1: Find Which Account Owns This API Key

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Look for API key ending in: `...1H4qg`
3. The account/email shown at the top right is the owner
4. Check the project name (likely related to "freshpunk" or your app)

### Step 2: Check Billing Status

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/billing
2. Check if you have an active billing account
3. Look for:
   - ‚úÖ **Billing account active** - Good!
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Free trial expired** - Need to enable billing
   - ‚ùå **No billing account** - Need to add one

**Important:** The Geocoding API has a **FREE tier**:
- **$200 free credit per month** (for all Google Cloud services)
- **First $200 of usage = FREE**
- Geocoding costs: ~$5 per 1,000 requests
- You'd need to make **40,000+ requests per month** to exceed free tier

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Fix the Current Error

### The Problem
Your API key has **HTTP referer restrictions** that prevent it from being used with the Geocoding API from a Flutter desktop/mobile app.

### Solution Options

#### Option 1: Remove Restrictions (Quick Fix - Development Only)
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Click on your API key (`AIzaSyCi_mKaxg-CRH3UJ5LVHGWTd7TUcl1H4qg`)
3. Scroll to **"Application restrictions"**
4. Change from **"HTTP referrers (web sites)"** to **"None"**
5. Click **"Save"**
6. Wait 1-2 minutes for changes to propagate
7. Test again

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This makes the key less secure. Only use for development/testing.

#### Option 2: Create a New Unrestricted API Key (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Click **"Create Credentials"** ‚Üí **"API key"**
3. Don't add any restrictions yet
4. Copy the new key
5. Replace in `simple_google_maps_service.dart` line 14
6. For production, add proper restrictions later

#### Option 3: Set Correct Restrictions for Desktop App
1. Go to your API key settings
2. Under **"Application restrictions"**:
   - Select **"None"** (desktop apps can't use referrer restrictions)
3. Under **"API restrictions"**:
   - Select **"Restrict key"**
   - Check only: **"Geocoding API"**
4. Save and test

## üí∞ Free Trial vs. Billing Questions

### Is Your Free Trial Over?
To check:
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/billing
2. Look for **"Free trial status"** banner
3. If expired, you'll see: *"Your free trial has ended"*

### What Happens After Free Trial?
- You still get **$200 free credit EVERY MONTH** (forever)
- You must add a credit card (but won't be charged unless you exceed $200/month)
- Geocoding API is very cheap - unlikely to exceed free tier

### Do You Need to Enable Billing?
If you see this error when trying to use the API:
```
"This API project is not authorized to use this API. Please ensure this API is activated in the Google Developers Console"
```
Then yes, you need to:
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/billing
2. Click **"Link a billing account"**
3. Add a credit card (you won't be charged if under $200/month)

## üß™ Quick Test Script

To test if the issue is billing or restrictions, try this:

1. Open a new terminal
2. Run this PowerShell command (replace YOUR_API_KEY if you create a new one):

```powershell
$apiKey = "AIzaSyCi_mKaxg-CRH3UJ5LVHGWTd7TUcl1H4qg"
$address = "350 5th Ave, New York, NY"
$url = "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=$address&key=$apiKey"

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Method Get | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5
```

**Expected Results:**

If **billing issue:**
```json
{
  "error_message": "This API project is not authorized to use this API",
  "status": "REQUEST_DENIED"
}
```

If **restriction issue** (current problem):
```json
{
  "error_message": "API keys with referer restrictions cannot be used with this API",
  "status": "REQUEST_DENIED"
}
```

If **working:**
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "results": [...]
}
```

## ‚úÖ Action Plan

### Immediate Steps:
1. ‚úÖ Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. ‚úÖ Find your API key
3. ‚úÖ Check which account/email owns it (shown in top-right corner)
4. ‚úÖ Remove HTTP referer restrictions (set to "None")
5. ‚úÖ Save and wait 1-2 minutes
6. ‚úÖ Test address validation in your app

### If Still Not Working:
1. Check billing at: https://console.cloud.google.com/billing
2. Ensure Geocoding API is enabled: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/geocoding-backend.googleapis.com
3. Create a new API key without restrictions
4. Update the key in your code

### For Production (Later):
1. Create separate API keys for each platform (Android, iOS, Web)
2. Add proper restrictions for each platform
3. Consider using a backend proxy to hide API keys

## üîê Security Note

**Your API key is currently exposed in your code!** This means:
- Anyone who gets your code can see the key
- They could use it and consume your quota
- For production, you should:
  - Use environment variables
  - Restrict the key properly
  - Consider a backend service

**Example of secure storage:**
```dart
// Don't commit this file to git!
// lib/config/api_keys.dart
class ApiKeys {
  static const String googleMapsKey = String.fromEnvironment(
    'GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY',
    defaultValue: 'YOUR_KEY_HERE',
  );
}
```

## üìû Need More Help?

If the issue persists:
1. Share screenshot of your Google Cloud Console ‚Üí API Credentials page
2. Check console logs when testing (look for specific error messages)
3. Verify the API key hasn't been deleted or disabled

**Most likely solution:** Just remove the referer restrictions and your app will work! üéâ
