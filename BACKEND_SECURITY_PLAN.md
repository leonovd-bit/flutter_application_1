# Backend Security & Data Management Plan

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ What's Already Implemented
1. **Firebase Functions**: Core functions with Stripe integration
2. **Firestore Security Rules**: Basic user-scoped access control
3. **Admin System**: Bootstrap admin granting with email allowlist
4. **Data Connect Schema**: Comprehensive GraphQL schema for meals, users, subscriptions
5. **Firebase Auth Integration**: User authentication system
6. **Stripe Integration**: Payment processing with webhooks

### ⚠️ Security Gaps Identified
1. **Firestore Rules**: Need more granular security for different data types
2. **Data Connect Auth**: Missing security directives on operations
3. **API Rate Limiting**: No rate limiting on Cloud Functions
4. **Input Validation**: Missing comprehensive validation
5. **Audit Logging**: No audit trail for admin actions
6. **Kitchen Dashboard**: Static access codes (security risk)
7. **Data Encryption**: No field-level encryption for sensitive data

## Security Improvements Plan

### 1. Enhanced Firestore Security Rules
- Implement role-based access control (admin, kitchen, customer)
- Add granular permissions for kitchen operations
- Implement proper validation rules for data integrity
- Add rate limiting and abuse protection

### 2. Data Connect Security
- Add @auth directives to all operations
- Implement user-scoped and admin-scoped operations
- Add proper validation and sanitization

### 3. Cloud Functions Security
- Implement request rate limiting
- Add comprehensive input validation
- Implement proper error handling without data leakage
- Add audit logging for all admin operations

### 4. Kitchen Dashboard Security
- Replace static access codes with proper authentication
- Implement JWT-based kitchen partner authentication
- Add role-based permissions for kitchen operations

### 5. Data Protection
- Implement field-level encryption for PII
- Add data retention policies
- Implement proper backup and recovery
- Add GDPR compliance features

### 6. Monitoring & Audit
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Add security event monitoring
- Implement anomaly detection
- Add compliance reporting

## Implementation Priority
1. **HIGH**: Firestore security rules enhancement
2. **HIGH**: Kitchen dashboard authentication
3. **MEDIUM**: Data Connect security directives
4. **MEDIUM**: Rate limiting and validation
5. **LOW**: Advanced monitoring and compliance
