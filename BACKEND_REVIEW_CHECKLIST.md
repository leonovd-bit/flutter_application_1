# Backend Code Review Checklist

## 🔴 CRITICAL - Security & Payment Review

### Firebase Security Rules (`firestore.rules`)
```javascript
// CURRENT RULES NEED REVIEW:
- User data isolation: users/{userId} documents
- Admin-only collections access
- Order and subscription read/write permissions
- Meal catalog public read access
```

### Cloud Functions Security (`functions/src/index.ts`)
```typescript
// PAYMENT FUNCTIONS - LINE BY LINE REVIEW NEEDED:

1. createPaymentIntent() - Lines ~200-250
   ❌ Check: Amount validation, currency handling
   ❌ Check: User authentication verification
   ❌ Check: Stripe customer creation logic

2. createSubscription() - Lines ~300-350  
   ❌ Check: Subscription plan validation
   ❌ Check: Trial period handling
   ❌ Check: Error rollback scenarios

3. stripeWebhook() - Lines ~700-800
   ❌ CRITICAL: Webhook signature verification
   ❌ Check: Event deduplication
   ❌ Check: Failed payment handling

4. grantAdmin() - Lines ~750-780
   ❌ Check: Bootstrap security bypass
   ❌ Check: Permission escalation prevention
```

## 🟡 MEDIUM - API Integration Review

### Stripe Integration Issues
```dart
// lib/app_v3/services/stripe_service_v3.dart
❌ Error handling in payment flows
❌ Payment method validation
❌ Subscription cancellation logic
❌ Refund processing workflows
```

### Firebase Client Services
```dart
// lib/app_v3/services/
❌ meal_service_v3.dart - Firestore query optimization
❌ order_service_v3.dart - Order state management
❌ user_profile_service_v3.dart - Data isolation
❌ subscription_service_v3.dart - Billing cycle logic
```

## 🟢 LOW - Code Quality & Performance

### Database Optimization
```json
// firestore.indexes.json
❌ Review composite indexes for queries
❌ Check query performance with large datasets
❌ Verify index usage in Cloud Functions
```

### Client-Side Error Handling
```dart
// Error handling patterns throughout app
❌ Network failure recovery
❌ Offline mode functionality  
❌ User-friendly error messages
❌ Crash reporting integration
```

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### 1. Stripe Webhook Security (URGENT)
**File**: `functions/src/index.ts` - `stripeWebhook()`
```typescript
// CURRENT CODE NEEDS VERIFICATION:
const sig = req.get('stripe-signature');
// ❌ Is signature verification implemented correctly?
// ❌ Are we handling webhook replay attacks?
// ❌ Is error logging sufficient for debugging?
```

### 2. Admin Privilege Escalation (URGENT)  
**File**: `functions/src/index.ts` - `grantAdmin()`
```typescript
// TEMPORARY BOOTSTRAP CODE:
const OWNER_EMAIL = "davleonovets@gmail.com";
const bootstrapAllowed = bootstrap === true && email === OWNER_EMAIL;
// ❌ REMOVE THIS AFTER INITIAL SETUP
// ❌ Implement proper admin invitation system
```

### 3. Payment Error Recovery (HIGH)
**Files**: All Stripe-related functions
```typescript
// COMMON ISSUES TO CHECK:
❌ What happens if Stripe is down?
❌ How are partial payments handled?
❌ Are subscription failures properly communicated?
❌ Is there a retry mechanism for failed payments?
```

## 🔧 Testing Requirements

### 1. Payment Flow Testing
```bash
# Required test scenarios:
❌ Successful payment with valid card
❌ Failed payment with declined card  
❌ Network failure during payment
❌ Subscription creation and billing
❌ Payment method updates
❌ Cancellation and refund flows
```

### 2. Security Testing
```bash
# Required security tests:
❌ Unauthorized access to user data
❌ Admin privilege escalation attempts
❌ Firestore rule bypass testing
❌ Cloud Function authentication bypass
❌ Stripe webhook signature spoofing
```

### 3. Integration Testing
```bash
# End-to-end workflow tests:
❌ New user signup → plan selection → payment → first order
❌ Subscription management → pause → resume → cancel
❌ Order placement → tracking → delivery confirmation
❌ Admin functions → user management → meal catalog updates
```

## 🚀 Performance Monitoring

### 1. Cloud Function Metrics
```javascript
// Monitor in Firebase Console:
❌ Function execution time (should be < 10s)
❌ Error rates (should be < 1%)
❌ Memory usage (optimize if > 256MB)
❌ Cold start frequency
```

### 2. Database Performance
```javascript
// Monitor in Firestore Console:
❌ Query execution time
❌ Index usage efficiency  
❌ Document read/write costs
❌ Concurrent connection limits
```

### 3. Client Performance
```dart
// Monitor in app:
❌ API response times
❌ Image loading performance
❌ Offline functionality
❌ Memory leaks in Flutter widgets
```

## 📋 Documentation Tasks

### 1. API Documentation
```markdown
❌ Document all Cloud Function endpoints
❌ Create Postman collection for testing
❌ Document authentication requirements
❌ Provide error code reference
```

### 2. Database Schema
```markdown  
❌ Document all Firestore collections
❌ Define field validation rules
❌ Create data migration procedures
❌ Document backup and recovery process
```

### 3. Deployment Procedures
```markdown
❌ Environment setup instructions
❌ Secrets management procedures
❌ Rolling deployment strategy
❌ Rollback procedures for issues
```

**Review Priority**: Start with 🔴 CRITICAL items first
**Timeline**: Security review should be completed within 48 hours
**Next Steps**: Schedule follow-up review after initial fixes
