// Per-day, per-meal configurations
Map<String, Map<String, Map<String, dynamic>>> _dayConfigurations = {};
```

#### Key Methods
```dart
void _selectAllDays()          // Selects all 7 days

void _showBulkConfigureDialog() // Opens bulk config dialog
Future<TimeOfDay?> _showCupertinoTimePicker() // iOS-style time picker
