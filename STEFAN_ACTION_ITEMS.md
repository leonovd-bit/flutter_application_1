## üéØ Alternatives Discussion

### Current Stack (Recommended - Keep As-Is)
‚úÖ **Firebase Suite** (Hosting, Firestore, Cloud Functions, Auth)
‚úÖ **Stripe** for payments
‚úÖ **Google Maps API** for location services

### Alternative Options (If Needed)
**You mentioned Vercel/Supabase alternatives:**

#### Option A: Keep Current Stack (Firebase)
- **Pros:** Already implemented, fully integrated, scalable, generous free tier
- **Cons:** None significant
- **Cost:** Free tier covers most needs; pay-as-you-go for scale
- **Recommendation:** ‚úÖ **STAY WITH FIREBASE** - no migration needed

#### Option B: Add Vercel (for Next.js Admin Dashboard)
- **Use Case:** If you want a separate Next.js admin portal
- **Current Status:** Not needed - admin functions already in Flutter app
- **Action:** Only add if you specifically want a web-only admin panel
- **Cost:** Vercel free tier is generous

#### Option C: Migrate to Supabase
- **Use Case:** If you prefer PostgreSQL over Firestore NoSQL
- **Current Status:** Major migration required (weeks of work)
- **Action:** ‚ùå **NOT RECOMMENDED** - stick with Firestore
- **Cost:** Similar to Firebase

**DECISION:** No changes needed. Firebase covers all requirements without Vercel or Supabase.

## üìä Data Export Status

### What's Included in `TEST_DATA.json`:
‚úÖ 5 sample meals with full nutritional info  
‚úÖ 3 meal plans (NutritiousJr, Diet Knight, Lean Freak)  
‚úÖ Test user accounts (admin, user, restaurant)  
‚úÖ Sample order structure  

### What Stefan Needs to Import:
1. **Meals:** Can be seeded via admin panel (once you grant Stefan admin role)
2. **Plans:** Already in Firestore or can be created via Firebase Console
3. **Users:** Stefan will create test accounts or you'll share existing credentials

## üêõ Known Issues Summary (Quick Reference)

| Priority | Issue | Status | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| **HIGH** | Desktop auth reauthentication hangs | Timeout added | Use web for account deletion |
| **MEDIUM** | Large meal images slow load | Tree-shaking done | Consider lazy loading |
| **MEDIUM** | Admin seed UI hidden | Commented out | Expose in admin dashboard or CLI |
| **LOW** | 362 linter warnings | Non-blocking | Clean up gradually |
| **LOW** | No test coverage | Manual testing | Add tests in future sprint |
