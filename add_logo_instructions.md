# Add Your FreshPunk Logo

## Quick Steps:
1. Save your FreshPunk logo image file to your computer
2. Copy it to this folder: `assets/images/`
3. Name it: `freshpunk_logo.png`
4. The app will automatically use it!

## Current logo location should be:
```
assets/images/freshpunk_logo.png
```

## To test:
After adding the image file, run: `flutter hot reload` (press 'r' in terminal)

The app is already set up to use your image file - we just need the actual file in place!
