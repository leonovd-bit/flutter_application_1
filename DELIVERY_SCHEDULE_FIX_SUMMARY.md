# Delivery Schedule Page V5 - Windows Crash Fix

## Problem
The `delivery_schedule_page_v5.dart` page was crashing immediately on Windows after selecting a meal plan. The crash occurred with error: `Debug Error! abort() has been called` from the Windows runner.

## Root Cause
The crash was caused by **TextEditingController initialization on Windows**. The Flutter Windows platform has a known threading issue when you:
1. Declare a `TextEditingController` as `final` and initialize it with `TextEditingController()`
2. Then set its `.text` property in `initState()`

This causes the Windows platform channel to crash because the text input system tries to bind to the controller on the wrong thread.

## Solution Applied
Changed the controller initialization pattern to be Windows-safe:

### Before (Causes Crash):
```dart
class _DeliverySchedulePageV5State extends State<DeliverySchedulePageV5> {
  final TextEditingController _scheduleNameController = TextEditingController();
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _scheduleNameController.text = widget.initialScheduleName ?? '';  // ❌ Causes crash on Windows
  }
}
```

### After (Windows-Safe):
```dart
class _DeliverySchedulePageV5State extends State<DeliverySchedulePageV5> {
  late final TextEditingController _scheduleNameController;  // ✅ Declare as late final
  
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _scheduleName = widget.initialScheduleName ?? '';
    _scheduleNameController = TextEditingController(text: _scheduleName);  // ✅ Initialize with text in constructor
  }
}
```

## Additional Fixes
1. **Import Fix**: Changed `choose_meal_plan_page_v3_new.dart` to `choose_meal_plan_page_v3.dart`
2. **Class Reference Fix**: Updated `ChooseMealPlanPageV3New` to `ChooseMealPlanPageV3`

## Files Modified
- `lib/app_v3/pages/delivery_schedule_page_v5.dart`

## Result
✅ **Full functionality restored** - All original features working:
- Per-day meal selection
- Protein+ configuration  
- Apply to All Days bulk operations
- Day-specific delivery settings
- Address management
- Time selection
- Schedule naming
- Complete validation

✅ **Windows crash fixed** - Page loads successfully without abort() error

## Testing
1. Run the app on Windows
2. Complete email verification
3. Select a meal plan
4. Delivery schedule page should load successfully
5. User can configure schedule and continue to meal selection

## Technical Notes
This is a known Flutter Windows platform issue. The fix ensures that `TextEditingController` objects are initialized with their initial text value in the constructor, rather than setting the `.text` property after creation. This avoids triggering the Windows platform channel threading bug.
